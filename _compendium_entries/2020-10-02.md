title: "COMPENDIUM ENTRY #3"
date: 2020-10-02
---
today’s update is super special because it is coming at [insert time] rather than 8am not because we forgot entirely but because we wanted to surprise you. surprise! This is the first update that will be accessible from [https://apc-gm.com/compendium](https://apc-gm.com/compendium){: target="_blank"}, a place where you can view all our compendiums, constantly updated, for the entire year. to put that page together in such short notice, we employed advanced coding tactics such as “googling what we wanted to do” and “shamelessly copying and pasting it.” revisions will come in time, but they’ll always be at [https://apc-gm.com/compendium](https://apc-gm.com/compendium){: target="_blank"}
